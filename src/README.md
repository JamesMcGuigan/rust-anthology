## The Rust Language

[__Finding Closure in Rust__] - [Huon Wilson]. Closures are functions
that can directly use variables from their enclosing scope. They are a
powerful tool in Rust, and come in several forms reflecting Rust's
ownership-based design. This chapter covers all the details, including
the `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` traits, captures and the `move` keyword.
