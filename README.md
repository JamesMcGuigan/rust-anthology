# Rust Anthology 1

The best short-form writing about Rust, collected.

Rust needs more docs! But actually, there are a lot of great docs out
there right now. They are just hard to find. This project aims to
collect them into a single book. Rust has a strong tradition of
technical writing, with many authors making a name for themselves in
the community as instructors.

## Goals

- The _primary_ goal is to collect valuable information into one
  place, get it under test, and present it in a consistent way.
- Celebrate authors of excellent Rust writing.
- Create a coherent full-length book.
- Publish a book in print form to help seed a market lacking in Rust books.
- Publish a book in print form as a point-of-pride for the community.
- Create a yearly tradition of collecting the best Rust writing.
- Incentivise yet more high-quality blogging about Rust with the anticipation
  of being selected for next-year's book.

[See the current draft](https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology).

## Process (roughly)

- Evaluate original posts for content, quality, and overall fit
  into the book's organization.
- Where chapters should be composed of multiple blog posts from a series, combine
  them into one with sections named "Part X: $post-title".
- Add the chapter to SUMMARY.md in an appropriate place.
- Add the chapter to intro.md with a 1-paragraph description.
- Get tests to pass.
- Edit chapters lightly for technical correctness and style.
- Append metadata about chapter, including source information and licensing
- Get approval from original author to use the content.

To get started, we don't have to be too picky. Just get chapters filled
out and into decent shape. Then we can make a second pass where we are
actually focused on polishing it into something publishable.

## On curation

There's a lot of good writing about Rust. Not all of it will make the
cut. We'll have to make some hard decisions, and some authors will
probably have their feelings hurt by not being included. That's just
the reality, and we have to manage it in the most diplomatic way
possible.

See [ranotes.md] for candidate chapters.
