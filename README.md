# Rust Anthology 1

The best short-form writing about Rust, collected.

Rust needs more documentation, right? But actually, there are a lot of
great docs out there right now, and a lot of talented writers
documenting Rust. They are just hard to find. This project aims to
collect them into a single book. Rust has a strong tradition of
technical writing, with many authors making a name for themselves in
the community as instructors.

## Goals

- The _primary_ goal is to collect valuable information into one
  place, get it under test, and present it in a consistent way.
- Celebrate authors of excellent Rust writing.
- Create a coherent full-length book.
- Publish a book in print form to help seed a market lacking in Rust books.
- Publish a book in print form as a point-of-pride for the community.
- Create a yearly tradition of collecting the best Rust writing.
- Incentivise yet more high-quality blogging about Rust with the anticipation
  of being selected for next-year's book.

## Process (roughly)

- Evaluate original posts for content, quality, and overall fit
  into the book's organization.
- Where chapters should be composed of multiple blog posts from a series, combine
  them into one with sections named "Part X: $post-title".
- Add the chapter to SUMMARY.md in an appropriate place.
- Add the chapter to intro.md with a 1-paragraph description.
- Get tests to pass.
- Edit chapters lightly for technical correctness and style.
- Append metadata about chapter, including source information and licensing
- Get approval from original author to use the content.

To get started, we don't have to be too picky. Just get chapters filled
out and into decent shape. Then we can make a second pass where we are
actually focused on polishing it into something publishable, and being
selective about chapters and organization.

## TODO

- Set up CI to publish automatically
- Write short, inspiring, introductory text
- Establish format of authors page

## On curation

There's a lot of good writing about Rust. Not all of it will make the
cut. We'll have to make some hard decisions, and some authors will
probably have their feelings hurt by not being included. That's just
reality, and we have to manage it as nicely as we can.

## Authorship and licensing

For now, consideration for the anthology is being managed
optimistically, assuming most will be happy to be included.

_If you are an author, you see your work being considered here, and
you do not want to be part of this, either file an issue asking to be
removed from consideration, or contact me privately. We want to
respect your wishes_.

Authors maintain ownership of their chapters, and each chapter is
licensed individually according to the author's preference. Ownership
of modifications to chapters as part of the editorial process is
relinquished to the original authors.

Additional content, such as chapter descriptions is owned by
the contributing editor and licensed CC-BY-4.0.

As an editor of Rust Anthology you must agree to these terms for your
contributions.
