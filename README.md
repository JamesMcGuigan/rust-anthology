# Rust Anthology 1

The best short-form writing about Rust, collected.

Rust needs more documentation, right? Well, yeah, it does, but there
are actually a lot of great Rust docs out there right now, and a lot
of great Rust writers! This project aims to collect their work into a
single book.

[See the current draft](https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology).

## Goals

- The _primary_ goal is to collect valuable information into one
  place, get it under test, and present it in a consistent way.
- Celebrate authors of excellent Rust documentation.
- Create a coherent full-length book.
- Publish a book in print form to help seed a market lacking in Rust books.
- Publish a book in print form as a point-of-pride for the community.
- Create a yearly tradition of collecting the best Rust writing.
- Incentivise yet more high-quality blogging about Rust with the anticipation
  of being selected for next-year's book.

## On curation

There is a lot of good writing about Rust. Not all of it will make the
cut. We'll have to make some hard decisions, and some authors will
probably have their feelings hurt by not being included. That's just
reality, and we have to manage it as nicely as we can.

## Authorship and licensing

Consideration for the anthology is being managed optimistically,
assuming most authors will be happy to be included. _If you are an
author, you see your work being considered here, and you do not want
to be part of this, either file an issue asking to be removed from
consideration, or contact me privately. We want to respect your
wishes_.

Authors maintain ownership of their chapters, and each chapter is
licensed individually according to the author's preference. Ownership
of modifications to chapters as part of the editorial process is
relinquished to the original authors. Additional content, such as
chapter descriptions is owned by the contributing editor and licensed
CC-BY-4.0.
