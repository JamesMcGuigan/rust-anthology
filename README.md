# Rust Anthology 1

The best short-form writing about Rust, collected.

Rust needs more docs! But actually, there are a lot of great docs out
there right now. They are just hard to find. This project aims to
collect them into a single book. Rust has a strong tradition of
technical writing, with many authors making a name for themselves in
the community as instructors.

## Goals

- The _primary_ goal is to collect valuable information into one
  place, get it under test, and present it in a consistent way.
- Celebrate authors of excellent Rust writing.
- Create a coherent full-length book.
- Publish a book in print form to help seed a market lacking in Rust books.
- Publish a book in print form as a point-of-pride for the community.
- Create a yearly tradition of collecting the best Rust writing.
- Incentivise yet more high-quality blogging about Rust with the anticipation
  of being selected for next-year's book.

[See the current draft](https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology).

## Process (roughly)

- Evaluate original posts for content, quality, and overall fit
  into the book's organization.
- Where chapters should be composed of multiple blog posts from a series, combine
  them into one with sections named "Part X: $post-title".
- Add them to SUMMARY.md in an appropriate place.
- Get tests to pass.
- Edit chapters lightly for technical correctness and style.
- Append metadata about chapter, including source information and licensing
- Get approval from original author to use the content.
